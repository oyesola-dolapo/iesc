        The primary preoccupation of true adherents of the Christian religion is
        to win souls for Christ. Your efforts in words and deeds will either
        make ir mar the realization of this noble aim. <br /> <br />
        Thus, it is the <span className={style}>Vision</span> of the{" "}
        <span className={style}>INRI EVANGELICAL SPIRITUAL CHURCH</span> to take
        the Gospel of Christ to all the nooks and crannies of the earth.
        Structures shall be put in place to simulate the entire populace to be
        partakers. <br /> <br />
        The <span className={style}>CHURCH</span> shall be actively involved in{" "}
        <span className={style}>EVANGELISM</span> and{" "}
        <span className={style}>WELFARE</span> services. For the Church the
        Gospel of the stomach must be preached in (pari-pasu) hand in hand.
        Hungry and poverty stricken individuals and societies are not likely to
        be easily convinced of the description of God in the superlatives (All
        Caring, All Loving, A Benevolent God e.t.c). <br /> <br />
        Thus, our <span className={style}>MISSION</span> is to preach{" "}
        <span className={style}>
          LOVE, ONENESS, SPIRITUAL PURIFICATION, KINDNESS AND MEEKNESS
        </span>{" "}
        among other positive attributes of true Christmas to everyone. <br />{" "}
        <br />
        All the Church Departments shall be active participants in the
        realization of all these. The Departments shall propelled into action by
        encouraging each one to carry out assigned programmes singularly or
        collectively in manners that will edify Christ.
