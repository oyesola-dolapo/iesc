          Primate (Dr) Babatunde Elijah Ayodele, founder - Pastor, INRI
          Evangelical Spiritual Church, llasamaja, Lagos recognised early in
          life the gift of God in him. When the Lord called him to devote his
          life to God's Glory, he was reluctant, because he wanted his freedom.{" "}
          <br /> <br />
          Born in Lagos in the early seventies to Chief Olalekan Oluwadamilare
          O. Ayodele, a.k.a. Ayomate, an Ikere Ekiti born businessman and cocoa
          merchant and Mrs. Margaret Ayodele from Benin City, Edo State, Primate
          Ayodele is the first of his parents' five children - three males and
          two females. <br /> <br />
          He schooled at MTC Primary School, Mushin, Lagos between 1975 - 1978,
          St Pius Catholic Primary School, Ikere Ekiti, 1978 - 1979;
          Annunciation School, Ikere Ekiti, 1980 to June 1986; Federal College
          of Aviation and Technology, Zaria, between 1989 and 1993, where he
          studied Aeronautics Engineering. <br /> <br />
          Among the people who assisted him in his educational pursuit is Alhaja
          Omowunmi Eti, whom Primate (Dr) Ayodele will ever be grateful to.{" "}
          <br /> <br />
          He did his industrial Training programme at Okada Airlines in the
          Ticketing department, Domestic Airport, Lagos. <br /> <br />
          Recognising his dedicated and selfless sevice to duty and enhanced
          humane relations with his co-workers, the management of Okada Airlines
          gave him an automatic full employment as station manager before the
          completion of his Industrial Training. <br /> <br /> Just when he was
          to begin enjoying the fruitsof his new appointment, he heard the
          Divine Voice of God as he was called upon to dedicate his life to
          serving God. He was then just twenty four years old. He saw vision and
          began to perform miracles to the surprise of his parents and
          contemporaries, both at home and at his place of work. <br /> <br />{" "}
          At first, Primate (Dr) Ayodele wanted to disobey God. He was reluctant
          to abandon his new job. He wasn't happy about this call by God. He
          later gave in to God's commandment because it was God's wish. To do
          otherwise many be catastrophic. The Lord wanted him for a purpose, he
          thought and finally gave in. He thereafter resigned his appointment
          with Okada Airlines to go into full time evangelism. Since then, he
          has never looked back and God has been performing wonders in his life,
          using him to change the lives of many people. <br /> <br />
          To prepare himself for the task ahead, Primate Babatunde Ayodele
          travelled to the Republic of Benin for spiritual rejuvination in
          Jungun - Dagbema (Pilgrims ground) a close town to Idi Iroko in Ogun
          State. He had however been prophesying and seeing vision about five
          years before his call by God. His miraculous deeds began when he was
          in the primary school. <br /> <br /> Primate (Dr) Ayodele received the
          Holy Ghost on February 14 (his birthday), 1988 at the age of eighteen
          and in November 1994, he was ordained by God as a Primate. Without
          doubt, he is by the Grace of God, the youngest primate in Nigeria.{" "}
          <br /> <br /> He pays homage to senior superintendent Adeniyi
          Awodiran, a union chairman at NIPOST, General Post Office, Marina,
          Lagos who enlightens him spiritually and gives him guidance. Most
          significantly, the Primate has assisted many men of God to establish
          churches when he was very young. The last of such churches, was the
          Chirst Apostolic Church, Aguda, Lagos. Others are: Redeemed Christian
          Church, Oregun, Ikeja, Lagos; Cherubim and Seraphim at Ijesa,
          Surulere; Celestial Church, Bode Thomas Parish, Lagos; Mosatic Light
          christ church (now Celestial Church of Christ, Mosatic Parish),
          Ikotun, Lagos. <br /> <br /> It was at the Mosatic Light church that
          Primate (Dr) Ayodele started exhibiting his spiritual work under
          Pastor Aruleba Abiodun with himself as the second - in - command.{" "}
          <br /> <br />
          INRI Evangelical Spiritual Church started worship in a small room at
          number 27, Gbadamosi commercial Street (within a Boys' Quarters of a
          building), in Ilasamaja in 1994 with three boys and four women. Today,
          God's power has manifested and the church has grown a thousand fold.{" "}
          <br /> <br />
          The church's name INRI Evangelical Spiritual Church (Ijo Itesiwaju
          Ihinrere ti Emi Oba Awon Juu) came through inspiration Luke 23:38 The
          church pays more attention to the gospel and counselling, and it is
          set to refine spiritualism. <br /> <br />
          There has been several temptations to divert the missionof Primate
          Ayodele. Infact, he has been lured by he flesh and the fear of not
          being able to get involved in social life, but he has remained
          steadfast to the task which God has chosen for him. Most of the people
          who come to him expect to meet an elderly personality, only to see a
          youngman who may pass as a disciple in the church. Yet he has never
          failed in his task because the Lord is with him. <br /> <br />
          According to Primate (Dr) Babtunde E. Ayodele, what is happening in
          his life is beyond his age. How God and the Holy Spirit has taken
          control of his life is beyond his understanding. Material wealth is
          yet to be his lot, but he remains contented, taking solace in the
          words of the Holy book: "Seek ye first the kingdom of God and all
          other things shall be added." <br /> <br /> Primate (Dr) Ayodele
          emphatically believes that there is no problem that is unsolvable
          through prayers and committment to the ways of the Lord. Before the
          end of 1996, young Primate (Dr) Babatunde Elijah Ayodele will be in
          London or Rome to be ordained as a Bishop.
