          started in a one room apartment at No 27 Gbadamosi Commercial Street,
          Ilasamaja area of Lagos on the 10th <br /> <br />
          The name of the Church was revealed by the Holy Spirit and the
          leadership constituted through Divine guidance before that day. There
          was the mighty presence of the Heavenly Hosts during the exercises;
          this was in the month of January, 1994. <br /> <br />
          There was no adequate space for us to conduct the service here thus on
          the 31st December 1994, we moved to house Number 1, Mabinuori Street
          in the same Ilasamaja. <br /> <br />
          We tested the nature and the spiritual strength of the Church on the
          last Sunday of the month of November, 1994. This took place at the
          Ilasa Court, Baale Street. Important personalities were invited to the
          service <br /> <br />

          is not a member of the number of the Christ Apostolic Church, the
          Cherubim and Seraphim Church, the Celestial Church of Christ or the
          member of any white garment church of any description. The Church is
          standing on it's own with it's own unique identity. <br /> <br />
          At No 1, Mabinuori Street where we moved to on the 31st December,
          1994, we could not put up any permanent structure, We operated under a
          shed covered with palm fronds. Later, we levied ourselves to be able
          to put a small plank structure at the venue. The floor was filled with
          Beach sand. That was the situation for the 5years we spend on this
          site. <br /> <br /> We moveed to Oke Afa and specifically to our own
          parcel of land at Primate Ayodele Crescent, Inri Bus-Stop Oke Afe
          where we also has our first service on this ground in December 200
